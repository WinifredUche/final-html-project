    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        I am <strong>Oko-inya Winifred Uchechukwu</strong> , from a middle-class family. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends.
         Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family and friends, to me family is everything. I come from a family of seven, 
         including my parents. My parents taught me from a young age to be a lover of education and to be the very best in life.
        <b> I am a keen reader of novel and books that boost my intellect.</b> I am an interesting, fun loving lady with a good sense of humor. 
        One thing about me that is important to know though is that i love impacting lives and also at first I come of as a very shy individualistic lady but once 
        I get to know people and am comfortable with my environment, <i> I am great</i>. It is hard for me to make friends but once I make them, itâ€™s great and I am all different.
         I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I give. I am very kind, compassionate, emotional and sensitive as my close friends will tell you. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. 
         I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very straight and honest person. I understand and know that we all put on a show sometimes and do not show who we really are or 
         what we feel but some people do this constantly and those kinds of people I cannot <del>stand.</del>
